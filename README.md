**Developer:** Artur Dobysh  
**Email:** [crazyrubic@gmail.com](mailto:crazyrubic@gmail.com)

This Privacy Policy (“**Policy**”) explains how *CrazyRubic* (“the Game,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) collects, stores, uses, and discloses information from users. By downloading, installing, accessing, or otherwise using the Game, you agree to the terms of this Policy. If you do not agree, please discontinue all use of the Game.

> **Note**: *CrazyRubic* is in development and not yet officially published. This Policy may be updated or finalized prior to or after the official release.

## 1. Scope & Overview

### Local Data Storage
The Game uses `UserDefaults` on your device to store gameplay data such as high scores, hero/planet ownership, perk counts, and preferences. This data remains local to your device unless you explicitly share it via third-party services (Game Center, AdMob, etc.).

### Notifications
The Game may request access to send local notifications (e.g., daily spin reminders). Notification texts are randomly selected from an in-app list and do not use personal data. You can enable or disable notifications in your device’s settings at any time.

### Game Center Integration (iOS)
When you connect to Apple’s Game Center, Apple may share a limited profile (e.g., anonymized player ID) to handle leaderboards or achievements. We do not collect additional personal details. Refer to [Apple’s Privacy Policy](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/) for details on how Apple processes data.

### In-App Purchases & Subscriptions (RevenueCat)
*CrazyRubic* uses **RevenueCat** to manage and validate in-app purchases and subscriptions (e.g., “Remove Ads”). RevenueCat may collect transaction identifiers and subscription statuses for purchase verification. We do **not** receive or store your financial information, as Apple or Google handle those securely. For more info, see the [RevenueCat Privacy Policy](https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy).

### Advertising & Monetization (Google AdMob)
If you have **not** purchased the remove-ads subscription, the Game uses **Google AdMob** to display ads (banner, interstitial, rewarded). AdMob may collect device identifiers (advertising ID, IP address, etc.) to provide personalized or contextual ads, subject to your device settings. See [How Google uses data](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites) for more details.

### No External Server for Gameplay Data
Gameplay data (scores, perks, etc.) is stored on your device or managed via Game Center, RevenueCat, or AdMob. We do not run our own cloud servers to store your personal data.

### Customer Support
If you contact us via [crazyrubic@gmail.com](mailto:crazyrubic@gmail.com), we may request logs or device info for troubleshooting. We only use such data to resolve issues and delete it when no longer needed.

## 2. How We Use Collected Information
- **Core Gameplay:** Storing data like high scores or purchased items to ensure the Game functions properly.  
- **Push Notifications:** Sending daily spin reminders or in-game alerts (optional and can be disabled anytime).  
- **Ad Serving & Monetization:** Using AdMob data to display relevant ads, unless you opt out via the remove-ads subscription.  
- **Purchase Verification:** RevenueCat validates transactions and subscriptions, enabling or disabling certain features (e.g., removing ads).  
- **Game Improvements:** Aggregated data (e.g., from Game Center or AdMob) may be used to enhance gameplay or fix issues.

## 3. Disclosure & Sharing of Information
- **Third-Party Providers:**  
  *CrazyRubic* integrates with:  
  - Apple Game Center (leaderboards, achievements)  
  - RevenueCat (purchase/subscription verification)  
  - Google AdMob (ads, analytics)  
  Each follows its own privacy policy.

- **Legal or Compliance Reasons:**  
  We may disclose data if required by law or to protect our rights and property.

- **Business Transactions:**  
  In the event of a merger, acquisition, or sale, relevant user information may be transferred to new ownership.

## 4. Data Security
We take reasonable steps to protect data on your device and that shared with third-party providers. However, no method of digital storage or transmission is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## 5. Children’s Privacy
The Game is not specifically directed to children under 13 (or 16, depending on jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal data from minors. If you believe a minor has provided personal data without guardian consent, contact us at [crazyrubic@gmail.com](mailto:crazyrubic@gmail.com) so we can remove it.

## 6. Your Choices & Controls

- **Game Center Settings:** Sign out or adjust privacy settings within Apple’s Game Center.  
- **Ad Preferences:** Opt out of personalized ads or reset your advertising ID in device settings.  
- **Subscriptions & Purchases:** Manage or cancel subscriptions in your Apple or Google account settings.

## 7. International Data Transfers
Your data may be processed in countries with differing data-protection laws. By using the Game, you consent to such international transfers.

## 8. External Links & Third-Party Sites
The Game may contain links to external sites or ads. We do not control those services and recommend reviewing their privacy policies before providing any information.

## 9. Policy Updates
As *CrazyRubic* evolves, we may revise this Policy to reflect new features or legal requirements. We will make reasonable efforts to notify you of significant changes (e.g., via an in-app notice). Continued use after changes are posted indicates acceptance.
