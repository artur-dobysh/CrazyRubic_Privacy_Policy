    <h1>CrazyRubic: Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Developer:</strong> Artur Dobysh<br>
       <strong>Email:</strong> <a href="mailto:crazyrubic@gmail.com">crazyrubic@gmail.com</a></p>
    <p>This Privacy Policy (“<strong>Policy</strong>”) explains how <em>CrazyRubic</em> (“the Game,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) collects, stores, uses, and discloses information from users. By downloading, installing, accessing, or otherwise using the Game, you agree to the terms of this Policy. If you do not agree, please discontinue all use of the Game.</p>
    <p><em>Note:</em> <em>CrazyRubic</em> is in development and not yet officially published. This Policy may be updated or finalized prior to or after the official release.</p>

    <h2>1. Scope &amp; Overview</h2>
    <h3>Local Data Storage</h3>
    <p>
      The Game uses <code>UserDefaults</code> on your device to store gameplay data (e.g., high scores, hero or planet ownership, perk counts, and preferences).
      This data remains local to your device unless explicitly shared via third-party services (Game Center, AdMob, etc.).
    </p>

    <h3>Notifications</h3>
    <p>
      The Game may request access to send local notifications (e.g., daily spin reminders). Notification texts are selected randomly from an in-app list; no personal data is used for these messages. You may enable or disable notifications in your device’s settings at any time.
    </p>

    <h3>Game Center Integration (iOS)</h3>
    <p>
      When you connect to Apple’s Game Center, Apple may share a limited profile (e.g., anonymized player ID) to handle leaderboards or achievements. We do not collect additional personal details. Game Center data is subject to 
      <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple’s Privacy Policy</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>In-App Purchases &amp; Subscriptions (RevenueCat)</h3>
    <p>
      <em>CrazyRubic</em> uses <strong>RevenueCat</strong> to manage and validate in-app purchases and subscriptions (e.g., “Remove Ads”). RevenueCat may collect transaction identifiers and subscription status for purchase verification. We do 
      not receive or store your financial information (credit card details), as those are handled securely by Apple or Google. Learn more: 
      <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RevenueCat’s Privacy Policy</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Advertising &amp; Monetization (Google AdMob)</h3>
    <p>
      If you have not purchased the remove-ads subscription, the Game uses <strong>Google AdMob</strong> to display ads (banner, interstitial, rewarded). Google AdMob may collect device identifiers (advertising ID, IP address, etc.) to provide personalized or contextual ads, subject to your device settings. 
      See <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How Google uses data</a> for details.
    </p>

    <h3>No External Server for Gameplay Data</h3>
    <p>
      Personal gameplay data (scores, perks, etc.) is stored on your device or via Game Center, RevenueCat, or AdMob. We do not operate our own cloud servers to store your personal data.
    </p>

    <h3>Customer Support</h3>
    <p>
      If you contact us via 
      <a href="mailto:crazyrubic@gmail.com">crazyrubic@gmail.com</a>, we may request logs or device info solely for troubleshooting. We only use such data to resolve issues and delete it once no longer needed.
    </p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Collected Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Core Gameplay:</strong> To store data like high scores or purchased items in order to run the Game effectively.</li>
      <li><strong>Push Notifications:</strong> Used for daily spin reminders or important in-game alerts, which you can disable anytime.</li>
      <li><strong>Ad Serving &amp; Monetization:</strong> AdMob data helps us display relevant ads, unless you opt out via subscription.</li>
      <li><strong>Purchase Verification:</strong> RevenueCat validates your transactions and subscription status, enabling or disabling certain in-game features (e.g., removing ads).</li>
      <li><strong>Game Improvements:</strong> Aggregated data (e.g., from Game Center or AdMob) may be used to enhance gameplay or fix issues.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Disclosure &amp; Sharing of Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Third-Party Providers:</strong> 
        <em>CrazyRubic</em> integrates with:
        <ul>
          <li>Apple Game Center (leaderboards/achievements)</li>
          <li>RevenueCat (purchase/subscription verification)</li>
          <li>Google AdMob (ads and analytics)</li>
        </ul>
        Each follows its own privacy terms.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Legal or Compliance Reasons:</strong> We may disclose data if required by law or to protect our rights and property.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Business Transactions:</strong> In the event of a merger, acquisition, or sale, relevant user information may transfer to new ownership.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
      We take reasonable measures to protect data on your device and shared with third-party providers. However, no method of digital storage or transmission is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      The Game is not specifically directed to children under 13 (or 16, depending on jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal data from minors. If you believe a minor has provided us personal data without guardian consent, 
      contact us at <a href="mailto:crazyrubic@gmail.com">crazyrubic@gmail.com</a> so we can remove it.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Your Choices &amp; Controls</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Disable Notifications:</strong> You can disable or manage notifications in your device settings.</li>
      <li><strong>Game Center Settings:</strong> Sign out or adjust privacy settings within Apple’s Game Center on your iOS device.</li>
      <li><strong>Ad Preferences:</strong> Opt out of personalized ads or reset your advertising ID in your device’s privacy settings.</li>
      <li><strong>Subscriptions &amp; Purchases:</strong> Manage or cancel subscriptions in your Apple ID account settings.</li>
      <li><strong>Local Data Removal:</strong> Deleting the Game from your device removes locally stored data, but data on third-party platforms may remain.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. International Data Transfers</h2>
    <p>
      Your data may be processed in countries with different data-protection laws. By using the Game, you consent to such international transfers.
    </p>

    <h2>8. External Links &amp; Third-Party Sites</h2>
    <p>
      The Game may contain links to external sites or ads. We do not control those services and recommend reading their privacy policies before providing any information.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Policy Updates</h2>
    <p>
      As <em>CrazyRubic</em> is under development, we may revise this Policy to reflect new features or legal requirements. We will make reasonable efforts to notify you of significant changes, for example via an in-app notice. Continued use after changes are posted indicates acceptance.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Disclaimer &amp; Developer Protection</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>No Warranty:</strong> <em>CrazyRubic</em> is provided “as is.” We disclaim all warranties, express or implied, except as required by law.</li>
      <li><strong>Liability Limitation:</strong> We are not liable for damages arising from unauthorized access, data breaches, or interruptions to the fullest extent permitted by law.</li>
      <li><strong>Indemnification:</strong> By using the Game, you agree to indemnify and hold harmless the developer from any claims or liabilities related to your use of the Game or breach of this Policy.</li>
    </ul>
